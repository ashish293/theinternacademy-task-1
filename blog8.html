				If you ask a group of people what eating healthy means to them, you’ll probably get a
				different answer every time.
				<br />

				For some, healthy eating means reining in a fast food habit or consuming more fruits and
				vegetables, while for others it may mean occasionally enjoying a piece of cake without
				feeling guilty.
				<br /><br />
				Still yet, those who have certain medical conditions and even food allergies may
				conceptualize the concept of healthy eating in their own unique way.
				<br /><br />

				In short, there’s no single right answer to what healthy eating means.
				<br /><br />
				Healthy eating is human, and as humans, we all have different wants and needs, which
				inevitably affect our food choices.
				<br /><br />
				What’s more, what healthy eating means to you may even change throughout the different
				stages of your life as you grow and adapt to your ever-changing needs.
				<br /><br />
				This article explores the human side of healthy eating, and I provide my own go-to tips to
				make it easier.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">What healthy eating means for me</h2>
			<p>
				A 30-minute walk in the morning can change your life! This is especially true if you are
				dealing with lifestyle-related diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease, etc. (1).
				<br /><br />A morning walk is easy on your joints and heart, and the fresh morning air can
				help calm your nerves, improve your mood, and keep you energetic and positive for the rest
				of the day. Just buy a pair of walking shoes and take a walk in the nearby park. But why
				should you walk only in the mornings? Well, here’s what science has to say.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">1. Lowers The Risk Of Diabetes</h2>
			<p>
				Diabetes is one of the most predominant lifestyle-related diseases these days. But you can
				tame this metabolic disorder if you walk in the mornings. <br /><br />
				According to research, a 30-minute morning walk can help improve blood sugar control as well
				as aid the management of insulin in Type II diabetes (2). It allows the cells in the muscles
				to use up more glucose, helps burn body fats that are not needed, and also aids in improving
				the Body Mass Index (BMI). This benefits diabetics immensely.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">2. Good For Your Heart</h2>
			<p>
				If you have heart problems, it might not be a good idea to run. But you can walk! The
				American Heart Association says that brisk walking can help reduce the risk of heart disease
				and stroke (3). <br /><br />
				Studies have shown that walking every morning for about 30 minutes can help lower blood
				pressure. Making morning walks a part of your daily routine can strengthen the heart and
				control blood pressure (4). Morning walks can also lower triglyceride levels and prevent
				hypertension.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">3. Aids Weight Loss</h2>
			<p>
				Experts say that you can lose weight healthily without changing your diet by walking every
				day, along with other moderate, vigorous exercises (5). Obesity is a major cause of diseases
				caused due to a sedentary lifestyle. If you need to lose weight (or your doctor has
				suggested so), start walking. <br /><br />
				Walking is easy on your heart, and you will work out without feeling exhausted. Nothing
				helps like a brisk walk for 30 to 40 minutes. It helps elevate the heart rate and burn
				calories that are essential for weight loss.
				<br /><br />
				Researchers have also found that walking can aid weight loss in obese patients by reducing
				overall body fat and improving flexibility and muscle strength (6), (7).
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">4. Prevents Arthritis And Osteoporosis</h2>
			<p>
				Leading an inactive life has many negative effects on the body, including stiff joints. The
				stiffness of joints can further lead to the development of the symptoms of arthritis.
				<br /><br />
				Recent studies suggest that moderate, vigorous physical activity, such as walking for five
				days or more in a week, can help relieve arthritis pain and stiffness and provide energy
				(8).
				<br /><br />
				Moreover, women are prone to losing bone density and developing osteoporosis. Walking
				exercises the joints gently and strengthens them, along with improving bone density (9).
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">5. Reduces The Risk Of Stroke</h2>
			<p>
				Brisk morning walks help in keeping the heart strong and healthy. According to research
				conducted by the University of South Carolina, walking briskly for half an hour five times a
				week helps in lowering the risk of strokes (10). <br /><br />
				Additionally, it has been shown that brisk morning walks promote functional recovery for
				people who have had a stroke (11).
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">6. Controls Cholesterol Levels</h2>
			<p>
				The body needs a certain amount of cholesterol to maintain optimum health and build cell
				membranes. However, there is a greater risk of heart problems when there is an excessive
				amount of blood lipids, especially when they are in the form of LDL cholesterol. br*2 At the
				same time, low amounts of HDL can also be harmful. Following an active lifestyle and
				including activities like walking in your regimen is an excellent way to make sure the
				levels of cholesterol in your body are regulated .
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">7. May Relieve Depression</h2>
			<p>
				Depression affects about 264 million people (16). This mood disorder may often give rise to
				many other disorders in youngsters and adults. The good news is if you can just get up and
				go out for a stroll, you can slowly tame the demons in your head. That’s because when you
				walk, the natural pain-killing endorphins flow properly throughout the body. <br /><br />
				Patients with depression found that walking fast every day for 35 to 60 minutes showed a
				significant improvement in their condition (17). An article published in the Scientific
				American confirms that 200 minutes of walking per week can make you feel more energetic and
				positive.
