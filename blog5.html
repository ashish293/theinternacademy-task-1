			<p>
				There are four basic steps to getting started with yoga. We have kept this list to the bare
				minimum–there is almost an endless amount to learn about both the physical yoga practices as
				well as the philosophical underpinnings of yoga. <br /><br />
				Once you have worked through this list, continue on with our Yoga for Beginner’s section and
				keep adding to your journey as it feels appropriate.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">1. Learn how to breathe</h2>
			<p>
				The most important thing to do in yoga is to breathe, especially when holding the postures.
				Learn the basic Dirga pranayama breath to use during yoga. <br /><br />Most importantly,
				breathe in and out through the nose into the belly. Read our Breathing in Asana article for
				more advice on breathing while practicing yoga poses. <br /><br />Most importantly, let your
				breath be your guide throughout your yoga practice.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">2. Start with a brief meditation and intention</h2>
			<p>
				Sit in easy pose or accomplished pose (or any comfortable seating position) and take a few
				minutes to ground, center and focus inwards with one of our meditations. <br /><br />You may
				also want to set an intention, goal or prayer for your practice at the beginning meditation.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">3. Use basic and beginning level postures</h2>

			<p>
				Make sure you have read our General Practice Guidelines before attempting any yoga poses.
				<br /><br />
				Start with one of our warm-up sequences and then try one of our basic yoga pose sequences
				and/or these simple postures: seated twist, cat, dog, down dog, child, cobra, mountain,
				triangle, forward bend. <br /><br />
				Then check out our list of best poses for beginners and explore our Yoga Pose section to
				find additional poses to add to your practice. It is best to add new poses very slowly.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">4. End with Shavasana (relaxation pose)</h2>
			<p>
				Always end your yoga practice with Shavasana, resting on your back and consciously relaxing
				your body for 5-15 minutes. It is also recommended to practice a short seated meditation
				after Shavasana to integrate your yoga practice and transition back into the world.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">Beginner Tips</h2>
			<p>
				Please note that it is common for the first couple of times practicing yoga to feel awkward
				and strange; this will pass with time and practice. <br /><br />Once you get comfortable
				with the practice you may consider setting some appropriate and reachable goals.
