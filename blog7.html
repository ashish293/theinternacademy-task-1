				A balanced diet is one that provides the body with all the essential nutrients, vitamins and
				minerals required to maintain cells, tissues and organs as well as to function correctly. A
				diet that is lacking in nutrients can lead to many different health problems ranging from
				tiredness and lack of energy to serious problems with the function of vital organs and lack
				of growth and development.

			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">How to achieve a healthy balanced diet?</h2>
			<p>
				To achieve a healthy, balanced diet, it is important to eat at least three meals a day and
				not to skip breakfast. <br /><br />
				Each meal should be composed of a variety of foods from each food group and portion sizes
				should be moderated to control calorie intake.
				<br /><br />
				Limiting alcohol consumption is also recommended, the US guidelines being one standard drink
				per day for women and two for men with two alcohol free days per week.
				<br /><br />
				The 2010 dietary guidelines from the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and
				Agriculture recommend that a diet that is low in saturated and trans fats, cholest<br /><br />erol,
				added sugar, salt and alcohol should be followed. A diet similar to the DASH (Dietary
				Approaches to Stop Hypertension or the Mediterranean diet) diet is recommended to fulfil
				these requirements. <br /><br />
				Calorie intake should also be balanced with physical activity and sedentary activities such
				as watching TV should be reduced.

				The lifestyle most of us are living in this generation and time constantly requires us to
				deliver fast and reliable results. In some parts, somehow we have been wired to expect the
				same for ourselves. <br /><br />We look for results that can reach us in the minimum time
				possible and are there to stay. But the question arises – how to lose weight fast? Well, we
				are all familiar with the options of diet food online. If you are somebody who is on his or
				her way to lose weight, you must at some point have searched for diet food delivery options.

				<br /><br />must have meddled with your decision. So what is stopping you from eating a
				balanced diet every day and working towards reaching your target? Complex office hours,
				inconvenience of cooking up several meals every day, or struggle of procuring the
				ingredients? <br /><br />Or does the lack of taste and boring foods demotivate you and throw
				you off track? We’ll all your reasons, excuses, and issues related to weight loss and
