				The adage “put good in, get good out” doesn’t just apply to the food you put in your body —
				it’s true for what you take in on social media, too. <br /><br />
				Just like eating nutrient-rich foods yields positive physical results, a “diet” of social
				accounts that inspire and encourage can move you forward in your journey toward a healthier
				life.<br /><br />

				That said, social media is famous for showcasing unrealistic images of health.
				<br /><br />
				Whether it’s images of unattainable bodies or no-leaf-out-of-place salads, many social media
				accounts can make you feel like a healthy lifestyle is only for a select few.
				<br /><br />
				However, this couldn’t be further from the truth.
				<br /><br />
				Instead of following accounts that leave you feeling discouraged, you can choose to
				subscribe to folks who demonstrate real-world ways to eat well while having honest
				conversations about the challenges of doing so.
				<br /><br />
				Want to craft a feed that nourishes your body and mind?
				<br /><br />
				Here are 11 inspiring healthy eating social media accounts worth following.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">Compston Kitchen</h2>
			<p>
				Stephen and Elise Compston aren’t just a married couple who likes to cook together — they’re
				also registered dietitians. <br /><br />
				Their hashtag, #upgradedeverydayeats, tells you all you need to know about their relatable
				approach to healthy, tasty everyday food.
				<br /><br />
				Combining their mutual expertise with the real-life challenges of parenting young kids, they
				provide fun, relatable posts for getting meals on the table in a flash.
				<br /><br />
				In particular, recipes with just a few ingredients are their strong suit. Don’t miss their
				4-ingredient tofu sheet-pan meal or 5-ingredient barbecue egg and cheese quesadillas.
				<br /><br />
				Also, be sure to check out their blog for even more quick and easy meal ideas.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">Budget Bytes</h2>
			<p>
				Some foodie social media accounts feature gorgeous recipe photos, but a closer look reveals
				that their ingredient lists cost a pretty penny (ahem… truffle oil everything). <br /><br />
				Not so with Budget Bytes! As its name suggests, this food blog’s social pages are dedicated
				to straightforward, healthy recipes that won’t break the bank.
				<br /><br />
				As a recent college grad struggling to make ends meet, founder Beth Moncel started her blog
				in 2009 as a way to document her experiments in creating low cost recipes.
				<br /><br />
				Now, with over 400,000 Instagram followers and an app that gives you her recipes all in one
				place, Budget Bytes is an excellent resource for anyone who’d like to eat well for less.
				<br /><br />
				Check out Moncel’s catalog of content for everything from comfort-food classics to vegan
				desserts to meal prep ideas.
