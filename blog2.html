				With the delta variant spreading across the United States and the increasing number of
				states dropping pandemic mask mandates, experts warn that even those fully vaccinated
				against COVID-19 may be at risk.
				<br /><br />
				Considering the threat presented by delta and other coronavirus variants, should vaccinated
				people continue to wear masks? Experts say vaccination doesn’t mean you’re completely
				protected from developing COVID-19.
				<br /><br />
				“Although the chance of contracting COVID-19 is low once an individual has been vaccinated,
				it is not zero,” Teresa Murray Amato, MD, chair of emergency medicine at Long Island Jewish
				Forest Hills in New York, told Healthline.

			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">Coronavirus variants present a risk to everyone</h2>
			<p>
				According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of July 7, about 55
				percent of Americans have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, and roughly 47
				percent of all Americans have been fully vaccinated. <br /><br />
				However, new variants may present new risks.
				<br /><br />
				The Times of Israel reported this week that recent research found that Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine
				is “less effective” against delta at about 60 percent protective. However, it was still over
				90 percent protective against hospitalization. Another preprint of a study found an mRNA
				vaccine to be effective against a lambda variant, which was discovered in Peru.
				<br /><br />
				The continuing evolution of the novel coronavirus with new variants presents vaccinated
				people with a critical decision about whether to mask up.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">CDC director: Vaccine offers “high degree” of protection</h2>
			<p>
				Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said last week in a briefing that vaccines are
				still highly effective against the variants and that the vast majority of new COVID-19 cases
				and deaths are in unvaccinated people. <br /><br />
				“Our authorized vaccines provide protection against the circulating variants in this
				country, including delta,” she said in the briefing. “Vaccination is how we protect these
				individuals, families, and communities, and prevent severe disease, hospitalizations, and
				deaths from COVID-19.”
				<br /><br />
				Amato advised that people with a high chance of severe disease should consult a healthcare
				professional regarding mask use.
				<br /><br />
				“If you are vulnerable to a poor outcome with a COVID-19 infection due to an underlying
				condition, please speak to your doctor regarding the risk and benefits of wearing a mask,”
				she said.
				<br /><br />
				She added that masks reduce transmissions.
				<br /><br />
				“We know that vaccination and masking wearing decrease the spread of COVID-19,” said Amato.
				“The more we can decrease transmission, the more we can decrease that chance of new variants
				emerging.”
