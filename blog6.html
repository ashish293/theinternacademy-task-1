				A lot of us experience back pain after long standing hours or performing activities which
				involve bending or stretching. <br /><br />Back pain is quite a common problem and with some
				exercises it can be reduced significantly and effectively. In one of her recent posts on
				Instagram, nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar shares exercises that can help you get rid of back
				pain and can also strengthen your spine. <br /><br />The exercises are especially beneficial
				for older adults and can help in improving their immunity, flexibility and fitness.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">1. Twisting posture</h2>
			<p>
				The twisting posture can be effective in reducing back pain. All you need is a chair. Sit on
				the side of the chair and twist your spine. Twist in a way that your back rotates roughly at
				90 degrees. <br /><br />Apart from offering relief form back pain, the twisting posture can
				also offer relief from constipation, mentions Diwekar. Make sure your shoulder blades are
				squeezed in as you perform the posture. <br /><br />
				Hold the chair tightly from the side. You should be able to open your chest wide. Try to
				turn as much as you can. <br /><br />The twisting posture can also be beneficial for people
				who experience pain in shoulders. Sit on the other side of the chair and twist from your
				pelvic area again.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">2. Bending forward posture</h2>
			<p>
				Do not perform this posture when your back pain is active. Once it has subsided, then work
				towards subsiding it. <br /><br />
				Sit on the chair, squeeze your shoulder blades, lift your chest up and simply bend forward.
				Do not shrink your chest. It should be lifted up throughout. Bend till your chest and
				stomach are flat on your thighs. Stay in the position for around five counts. Come up
				slowly.
				<br /><br />
				If you are unable to bend forward, then you can put another chair in front of you, extend
				your arms on that chair and then bend forward. Remember to not shrink your chest in. It
				should be wide open.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">3. Alternate arms and leg raises</h2>
			<p>
				Come on all fours. Do alternate arms and leg raise. That is, lift leg and right arm and vice
				versa. Hold for 5 counts and release, and then repeat on the other side. <br /><br />
				If you are unable to maintain balance in this posture, the lie down your stomach, and do
				alternate arms and leg stretch.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">4. Calf rest</h2>
			<p>
				Back pain can also be reduced by giving your calves some rest. Lie down on the floor with
				your claves on the chair. Separate your knees and stay in this position for a while. You can
				also lie down on your bed and put your calves on a stack of pillows. Come down one leg at a
				time and by getting on the side. <br /><br />
