				If you ask a group of people what eating healthy means to them, you’ll probably get a
				different answer every time.
				<br />

				For some, healthy eating means reining in a fast food habit or consuming more fruits and
				vegetables, while for others it may mean occasionally enjoying a piece of cake without
				feeling guilty.
				<br /><br />
				Still yet, those who have certain medical conditions and even food allergies may
				conceptualize the concept of healthy eating in their own unique way.
				<br /><br />

				In short, there’s no single right answer to what healthy eating means.
				<br /><br />
				Healthy eating is human, and as humans, we all have different wants and needs, which
				inevitably affect our food choices.
				<br /><br />
				What’s more, what healthy eating means to you may even change throughout the different
				stages of your life as you grow and adapt to your ever-changing needs.
				<br /><br />
				This article explores the human side of healthy eating, and I provide my own go-to tips to
				make it easier.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">What healthy eating means for me</h2>
			<p>
				The definition of healthy eating has changed for me a couple of times in the past few years.
				<br /><br />
				By the time I was in college, healthy eating was about following nutritional guidelines and
				doing everything by the book. However, it meant that my view of the food on my plate had
				changed. I went from seeing meals I enjoyed to only seeing nutrients.
				<br /><br />
				Suddenly, I went from seeing traditional Costa Rican gallo pinto — or rice and beans — to
				seeing complex carbs and plant-based proteins.
				<br /><br />
				Then, when I started practicing as a nutritionist, the notion that a dietitian should look a
				certain way or fit into a specific body type led me to believe that healthy eating meant
				measuring my food to know exactly what I was consuming. I would eat whatever I wanted, as
				long as the nutrients I needed were accounted for.
				<br /><br />
				I gave my body everything it needed to be healthy, but healthy eating goes beyond the
				nutrients. It’s also about how it makes you feel, and with food being an essential part of
				culture and social events, eating should be something we enjoy.
				<br /><br />
				Today I have a different approach to healthy eating. I’m far more flexible with my meals,
				and I understand that balance is key to being nourished and happy with food.
				<br /><br />
				Healthy eating now means that, most of the time, I make sure to have food from all food
				groups on my plate without measuring anything or thinking about plant-based vs. animal-based
				protein or simple vs. complex carbs.
				<br /><br />
				It also means that I get to enjoy a bit of everything — including sweets, fast food, and
				desserts — with moderation and without the need to measure or account for it.
				<br /><br />
				As you can see, finding the balance that worked for me didn’t happen overnight. On the
				contrary, my definition of healthy eating has been changing as I’ve gone through the
				different stages of my life.
				<br /><br />
				As long as you aim to nourish your body and listen to what it needs, you can also give
				healthy eating your own meaning, because healthy eating is for everyone.
			</p>
			<h2 class="blog-subtitle">Seeing the big picture</h2>
			<p>
				As with many things in life, eating healthy doesn’t always end up as you planned.
				<br /><br />
				You may find yourself stuck at work late at night or too tired to prepare a home-cooked
				dinner, and that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t order take-out and actually enjoy it.
				<br /><br />
				If healthy eating means being flexible with what you eat, you’ll need to learn to adapt to
				the circumstances, which may happen more often than not.
				<br /><br />
				In cases when I’m choosing food on the spur of the moment, I try to opt for the best choice
				out of what I’m given. Whenever I can, I try to order the closest thing to a home-cooked
				meal or go for a sandwich, salad, or bowl.
				<br /><br />
				Yet, sometimes I do crave some pizza — so I eat and enjoy that, too!
				<br /><br />
				At times like this, I remember to see the bigger picture. That is, that healthy eating is
				not defined by single meals but by the choices we make day after day.
				<br /><br />
				A close friend once told me a saying that goes, “One bad meal will not make you sick, just
				as one good meal will not make you healthy.”
